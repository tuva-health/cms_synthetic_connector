# CMS Synthetic Connector

## Overview

This dbt project loads the 10,000 patient synthetic claims dataset from [CMS](https://data.cms.gov/collection/synthetic-medicare-enrollment-fee-for-service-claims-and-prescription-drug-event) and transforms it into the Tuva data model.

## 🔌 Database Support

Currently, this has only been tested on Snowflake. It likely needs small syntax adjustments to work on other database types.

## ✅ How to get started

### Pre-requisites
1. You have [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/) installed and configured (i.e. connected to your data warehouse). If you have not installed dbt, [here](https://docs.getdbt.com/dbt-cli/installation) are instructions for doing so.
2. You have created a database for the output of this project to be written in your data warehouse.

### Getting Started
Complete the following steps to configure the project to run in your environment.

1. [Clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) this repo to your local machine or environment.
2. Update the `dbt_project.yml` file:
   1. Add the dbt profile connected to your data warehouse.
3. Run `dbt deps` to install the Tuva Project package. 
4. Run `dbt build` to run the entire project with the built-in sample data.
